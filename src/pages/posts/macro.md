Macros are nothing but _mapping of_ some pattern to some other pattern. It becomes very handy to use macros in our computer program to make some repetitive and frequently used logic shortened.

Example `#define PI 3.14` is one of the most known examples for macros. Here the PI is replaced by 3.14 in every place of the program where PI is used **before compilation**.

**Keyboard and Mouse Macros**

- They are used to specify the task(sequence of keystrokes) that needs to be performed when a certain keystroke or input is given. By this, the repetitive sequence of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated.
  Here we are mapping a short mouse event to the sequence of repetitive mouse events.

**Fun Fact:** Your best editor(maybe) Emacs is the short form for “Editing macros”.

Emacs (and also Vim) supports macros where you can map certain keystrokes to another.
